A collection of astronomical data available online and the science we can extract from them. 

There is a lot of free data online and a lot of places to access it from. One of my favorites is the [sdss skyserver](http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/home.aspx). I intend to find this data, modify it and finally extract useful/popular results from it. There are basic/advanced/research projects available on the sdss dr10 [projects](http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/proj/projhome.aspx) site. 

implemented so far -
* the HR diagram. data sets include 300 stars, 5000 stars, globular cluster dada and links to data from the Hipparchos and Tycho catalogues! 
* sdss object colors - 100,000 objects from the SDSS DR10.
* celestial plotting using matplotlib and galactic coordinates for quasars from the SDSS DR10.

to be implemented - 
* galactic distribution of stars and the evident spiral arms! - distance/parallax and l,b/ra,dec data from hipparcos/tycho.
* color-color diagram for galaxies to differentiate between the spirals and ellipticals.
* color-distance plots for galaxy clusters to prove that older galaxies lie at the center and that younger ones are at the outskirts.

* implemeting the cosmic distance ladder, starting with 
  * stellar parallax, hipparcos/tycho data already available.
  * stellar color data available from HR diagrams for main sequence fitting
  * RR lyrae and cepheid variable data needed
  * supernova data needed
  * Tully-Fisher data needed
  * hubble law data needed
  * (am i missing anything?)
