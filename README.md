A collection of astronomical data available online and the science we can extract from them. 

There is a lot of free data online and a lot of places to access it from. One of my favorites is the [sdss skyserver](http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/home.aspx). I intend to find this data, modify it and finally extract useful/popular results from it. There are basic/advanced/research projects available on the sdss dr10 [projects](http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr10/en/proj/projhome.aspx) site. 

implemented so far -
* the HR diagram. data sets include 300 stars, 5000 stars, globular cluster dada and links to data from the Hipparchos and Tycho catalogues! 
* sdss object colors - 100,000 objects from the SDSS DR10.
* celestial plotting using matplotlib and galactic coordinates for quasars from the SDSS DR10.
* sdss anomalous object coordinate, color and spectra. <- needs to be moved to quasar_colors

to be implemented - 
* galactic distribution of stars and the evident spiral arms! - need data on distance/parallax and l,b.
* color-color diagram for galaxies to differentiate between the spirals and ellipticals.
* color-distance plots for galaxy clusters.
