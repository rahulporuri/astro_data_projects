The above available data has been cleaned for easy extraction of parameters. It's a sad thing that data cleaning is still an compulsory task!

The 314 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 3.55 in both
hemispheres are listed with 1996.5 positions.
Several spectral classifications have been updated by Garrison as
part of his continuing contribution to the Michigan Spectral Catalogue
project.  Data on the five Cepheid variable stars appearing in this
table have also been updated following work by Fernie and Beattie 
on the Galactic Cepheid Database (World Wide Web URL:  
<a href="http://ddo.astro.utoronto.ca/cepheids.html">
http://ddo.astro.utoronto.ca/cepheids.html</a>).
A few additional changes have been made because of better 
available data.

<br>
</p><h4> Star</h4>  If the star is a visual double, the letter A
indicates that the
data are for the brighter component.  The brightness and separation
of the second component (B) are given in the last column.  Sometimes the
double is too close to be conveniently resolved and the data
refer to the combined light (AB); in interpreting such data the magnitudes
of the two components must be considered.

<p>
</p><h4> Apparent Visual Magnitude (V).</h4>  These magnitudes are based on photoelectric 
observations.  The V filter is yellow and corresponds roughly to the
response of the eye.  The photometric system is that of 
Johnson and Morgan in <i> Ap.J.</i>, vol. 117, p. 313, 1953.  It is
as likely as not that the true magnitude is within 0.03 mag.
of the quoted figure, on the average.  Variable stars are indicated with
a ``v''.  The type of variability, range and period are given in the
remarks.

<p>
</p><h4> Colour Index (B-V).</h4>  The blue magnitude, B,
is the brightness of a 
star as observed photoelectrically through a blue filter.  The difference 
B-V is therefore a measure of the colour of a star.  There is a close
relation  between B-V and the spectral type, but some of the stars are 
reddened by interstellar dust.  The probable error of a value of B-V
is about 0.02 mag at most.

<p>
</p><h4> Spectral Classification.</h4>  A ``temperature''
type (O,B,A,F,G,K,M) is
given first, followed by a finer subtype (0-9) and a ``luminosity''
class (Roman numerals I-IV, with an ``a'' or ``b'' added occasionally
to indicate slightly brighter or fainter).  The sequences are in the sense that
the O stars are hottest, M stars are coolest, Ia stars are the most 
luminous supergiants, III stars are giants and V stars are the most numerous;
the V's are known as dwarfs or main-sequence stars.  Other symbols used in
the column are:  ``p'' for peculiar; ``e'' for hydrogen emission; ``m'' for 
strong metallic lines; ``f'' for broad, non-hydrogen emission in hot stars; and
``n'' or ``nn'' for unusually broad lines (= rotation).  The table 
contains the best types available, either from the literature or
from my own plates.

</p><h4> Parallax, Proper Motion and Position Angle. </h4> 
From ``The Bright Star Catalogue'' 
by Dorrit
Hoffleit and Carlos Jaschek, <i> Yale University Press</i>, 1982.  Parallaxes
in which the decimal point is preceded by the letter ``D'' are ``dynamical 
parallaxes''  (i.e. determined through Kepler's laws rather than
by trigonometric measurement).  Proper motions given are
the absolute value of the vector resultant from the individual-coordinate
proper motions given in ``The Bright Star Catalogue''.  The Position Angle
indicates the direction of the proper motion with an angle measured in
degrees from the north through east.

<p>
</p><h4> Absolute Visual Magnitude and Distance in Light-Years.</h4>  If the
parallax is greater that 0.05" the distance and absolute magnitude correspond
to this trigonometric parallax.  Otherwise a generally more accurate absolute
magnitude and distance were obtained from a new (by the author,
unpublished) calibration of the spectral classification; distances determined
in this way are called ``spectroscopic parallaxes''.  In
a few cases (the Hyades,
Orion, and Scorpius clusters), the cluster distances are given; these are 
indicated by parentheses.  The effect of the absorption of light was corrected
by comparing the spectral classification and the B-V, using an
intrinsic-colour calibration by the author (unpublished).

<p>
</p><h4> Radial Velocity</h4> From ``The Bright Star Catalogue'' 
referenced above.
The symbol ``V'' indicates a variable velocity and 
an orbit is usually not known.
On the other hand, ``SB'' indicates a spectroscopic binary, which is an
unresolved system whose duplicity is revealed by periodic
oscillations of the lines in its spectrum and an orbit is generally known.  
If the lines of both stars are detectable, the symbol ``SB2'' is used.
``+'' indicates motion away from, ``--'' towards, the observer.

</p><h4>Remarks</h4>  These contain data on companions and variability as well
as notes on the spectra.  Traditional names have been selected from ``The
Bright Star Catalogue''.
