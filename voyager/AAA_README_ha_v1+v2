The files in this directory contain the Voyager hourly average plasma data.
The plasma parameters are obtained by finding the best fit of a convected
isotropic Maxwellian distribution to the data. One sigma errors
are typically less than 0.5% in the speed and VR, less than 5% for the
density and thermal speed, and vary greatly for VT and VN.
Sampling times range from 12 to 192 sec., with sampling generally more
frequent early in the mission. The columns are:

1) Year                                         
2) day of year (day 1 is Jan. 1)
3) hour
4) proton speed in km/s (magnitude of V)
5) proton density in cm-3
6) proton thermal speed in km/s (proton temperature in eV = .0052 times the square of the thermal speed)
7) VR
8) VT (WARNING: this parameter is often NOT reliable after 1989)
9) VN (WARNING: this parameter is often NOT reliable after 1989)

The velocity components are given in the RTN coordinate system,  
where R is radially outward, T is in a plane parallel to the solar
equatorial plane and positive in the direction of solar rotation,
and N completes a right-handed system.
 
Please consult with us, or at least send preprints, when you use this data to
prevent grievous errors or misconceptions. (John Richardson, jdr@space.mit.edu)
