      "you are currently viewing an ipython notebook file online. If you look at the url closely, it will show you that you are currently looking at a .ipynb file, located in a github repository online, viewed using the nb(notebook) viewer. For those of you familiar with mathematica, the ipython notebook is similar to a mathematica notebook. For the rest, an ipython notebook is a medium in which one can run python code, write elaborate appendices (in LaTeX) explaining the theory behind code and include plots or figures relevant to the code. Simply put, IPython and the IPython notebook are python working environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working in python and working environments in python are not necessarily the same. If you want to learn or use python, the noob way to do it would be to work on the python prompt, which can be accessed on a unix terminal by typing python. This is how I started learning python, not exactly an easy way to start working in python. Granted, this has taught me a lot of things about python and a few interesting tricks but again, it's easy for someone to get put off by having to work on the python prompt.\n",

      "An easier way to work in python is by executing python files on the terminal. For those of you comfortable with pre-compiled languages like C or C++, you will notice that python files don't need to be compiled before being executed. Python is a dynamically-typed language, unlike statically-typed languages like C or C++.\n",

      "now, coming to working environments, for those of you who have worked on MATLAB before, you'll understand that MATLAB comes with a working environment i.e it installs all of the necessary libraries, it has GUI elements that show the data loaded during execution, it displays the plots using other GUI elements and it has an easy way to search, access and install other packages. Similarly, examples of working environments for python are [IPython](ipython.org/), [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda), [canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), [PYcharm](www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and so on and so forth. I have only barely scratched anaconda and canopy and I mostly work on IPython, working on the terminal a few times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaguely speaking, a working environments makes life easier to work using a specific language. Visualising data accessed by the program is hard while working on the python prompt or the terminal but easy on the working environments. Accessing and installing packages will be a bit of a hassle normally but working environments come with GUI elements that make life easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, I mostly use IPython to code in python, specifically the IPython notebook. IPython comes with certain packages pre-installed but the reason I use it the most is because of the IPython notebook, referred to herewith as ipynb. ipynb files have text cells, like this one, and code cells, like what you will see further. The python interpreter executes the code in code cells and the text cells, as I mentioned earlier, help with documentation and comments. One can also include figures or plots in an ipynb file, as you will see further. Overall, using ipynb files helps me find my code, my comments/documentation and my results at the same place.\n",
